## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4 with Shadcn/UI components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with organization support
- **Email**: React Email with Resend
- **Payments**: Stripe integration
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for e2e
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

### Project Structure

- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `src/components/` - UI components (Shadcn/UI in `ui/`, custom in `nowts/`)
- `src/features/` - Feature-specific components and logic
- `src/lib/` - Utilities, configurations, and services
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `emails/` - Email templates using React Email
- `prisma/` - Database schema and migrations
- `e2e/` - End-to-end tests
- `__tests__/` - Unit tests

### Key Features

- **Multi-tenant Organizations**: Full organization management with roles and permissions
- **Authentication**: Email/password, magic links, OAuth (GitHub, Google)
- **Billing**: Stripe subscriptions with plan management
- **Dialog System**: Global dialog manager for modals and confirmations
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation and server actions
- **Email System**: Transactional emails with React Email

## Code Conventions

### TypeScript

- Use `type` over `interface` (enforced by ESLint)
- Prefer functional components with TypeScript types
- No enums - use maps instead
- Strict TypeScript configuration

### React/Next.js

- Prefer React Server Components over client components
- Use `"use client"` only for Web API access in small components
- Wrap client components in `Suspense` with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components

### Styling

- Mobile-first approach with TailwindCSS
- Use Shadcn/UI components from `src/components/ui/`
- Custom components in `src/components/nowts/`

### State Management

- Use `nuqs` for URL search parameter state
- Zustand for global state (see dialog-store.ts)
- TanStack Query for server state

### Forms and Server Actions

- Use React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Server actions in `.action.ts` files
- Use `resolveActionResult` helper for mutations
- Follow form creation pattern in `/src/features/form/`

### Authentication

- Use `getUser()` for optional user (server-side)
- Use `getRequiredUser()` for required user (server-side)
- Use `useSession()` from auth-client.ts (client-side)
- Use `getCurrentOrgCache()` to get the current org

### Database

- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- Database hooks for user creation setup
- Organization-based data access patterns

### Dialog System

- Use `dialogManager` for global modals
- Types: confirm, input, custom dialogs
- Automatic loading states and error handling

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Located in `__tests__/` directory
- Use Vitest with React Testing Library
- Mock extended with `vitest-mock-extended`

### E2E Tests

- Located in `e2e/` directory
- Use Playwright with custom test utilities
- Helper functions in `e2e/utils/`

## Important Files

- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication configuration
- `src/features/dialog-manager/` - Global dialog system
- `src/lib/actions/actions-utils.ts` - Server action utilities
- `src/components/ui/form.tsx` - Form components
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
- `src/site-config.ts` - Site configuration

## Development Notes

- Always use `pnpm` for package management
- Use TypeScript strict mode - no `any` types
- Prefer server components and avoid unnecessary client-side state

## Debugging and complexe tasks

- For complexe logic and debugging, use logs. Add a lot of logs at each steps and ASK ME TO SEND YOU the logs so you can debugs easily.
